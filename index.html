          HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as
          JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.
          Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World
          Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current
          maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over
          explicit presentational HTML since 1997.

        <p class="box">
          CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
          including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve
          content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
          specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web
          pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
          separate.

        <h2 class="abc">JavaScript</h2>
        <p class="box">
          JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
          conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[10] JavaScript is
          high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has
          curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
          object-orientation, and first-class functions.
